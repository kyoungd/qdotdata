                                        TOHI, translating to "Stewards of the Earth," highlights the critical need for better waste management in the U.S. Ignoring recycling revenue causes companies to miss out on approximately $30 billion annually and leads to unnecessary waste polluting our landfills.

                                        We created a national database that connects waste creators, recyclers, and feedstock purchasers to optimize opportunities. This database includes locations, materials, capacities, regulations, and subsidies. We work with businesses to coordinate local recycling schedules, maximizing efficiency and capacity.

                                        Instead of paying disposal fees and facing fines, our customers earn material fees, carbon credits, and rebates. With TOHI, everyone benefitsâ€”businesses, the environment, and the community. Join us in protecting America and promoting a profitable, sustainable model.
