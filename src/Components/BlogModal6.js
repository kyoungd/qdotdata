                                        Another major issue plaguing the world is the incredible amount of water required to push oil out of the ground that is unquestionably needed for our society to exist.

                                        Additionally, once that water has been contaminated, it is traditionally injected into deep wells so it will never be used again requiring a huge resupply requirement and it will hopefully not contaminate the existing underground groundwater aquifers. QH2O has been developed to resolve both those problems at a very low cost. Using its proprietary technology, QH2O separates the oil from water and heavy solids so no oil is wasted, the water is clean enough to be continually used and the heavy solids can be used for industrial applications like road base, fill dirt... Since QH2O does not use filters, membranes, manifolds, electrical probes, magnets... it does not require maintenance which solves another major problem in the industry.
