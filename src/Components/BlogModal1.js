                                        Qalm has been commissioned to create an innovative job app on a global basis aimed at resolving a currently unaddressed problem that touches almost everyone. "Micro Tasks". 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A Micro Task is something that can be handled in minutes or hours if you just had someone in the geographic location where a problem needs to be resolved. Who has't seen a car on ebay, craigslist.. and wondered whether the offer you are seeing is actually real? With Qalm, app users can pickup work by handling the verification (wherever seller says it is located) by taking pictures, asking getting documents... or if you are traveling and you need someone to translate for a meeting, resolve an issue... There are literally millions of issues that arise every day where a micro job can resolve the need. 
                                    </p>

                                        However, according to a report by Transparency Market Research, the global micro-task market was valued at USD 1.5 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.6% from 2020 to 2030.
