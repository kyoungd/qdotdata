                                        Angellink was designed to resolve another critical problem involving helping others.

                                        Instead of most (if not all) your donations going to cover inflated costs, overhead and let's face it, sometimes greed, Angellink is designed so every donation can be tracked to fulfillment with video and GPS tracking documentation required for all payments showing the project and monies were spent as donated.
                                    </p>
