                                        QLAN is designed for large commercial properties to drastically reduce lighting and electrical costs by creating a wireless LAN using the building lighting, A/C controls and security system to create a "wireless mesh network" that actually creates power back to  the electrical grid while also creating a robust WiFi network allowing building occupants to utilize their computers, phones, printers...
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This mesh network allows the building owner to become the wireless provider for all occupants which includes TV, Phone and Internet revenues.
